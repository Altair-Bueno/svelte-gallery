          One or many rough sketches will be sent.<br />

          I'll send WIPs during the process (after sketch and line).<br />
          Changes can be requested before lineart is done.<br />
          I won't do more than 4 changes.<br />
          Asking for many changes may incur into additional charges.<br />
